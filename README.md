# JavaScript Tetris Game

This is a JavaScript version of the classic Tetris game that runs directly in your web browser. The game's interface includes a main playing area where Tetrominoes (the Tetris blocks) descend, and a sidebar displaying your current score and the number of rows you've cleared.

## How to Play

### Start the Game
- Press the Space key or click on the "Press Space to Play" link to begin.

### Objective
- Arrange the falling Tetrominoes to form complete horizontal lines without any gaps.

### Gameplay
- **Manipulate Blocks**: As the Tetrominoes fall, use your keyboard controls to move and rotate them.
- **Clear Lines**: When you fill an entire row, it will disappear, and you'll earn points.

### Scoring
- Your current score and the total rows cleared are displayed on the sidebar.
- Strive to clear as many lines as possible to increase your score.

### Game Over
- The game ends when the stack of Tetrominoes reaches the top of the playing field.

Enjoy stacking the blocks and aim for the highest score!
